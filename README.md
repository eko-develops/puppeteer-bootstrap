# puppeteer-bootstrap

Start up configuration for puppeteer

## How to Use

Install the project using NodeJS

```
npm install
```

Edit the `browser.config.js` and `puppeteer.config.js` configuration files if needed. If changes are made in `puppeteer.config.js`, the `puppeteer` module will need to be uninstalled and re-installed.

The project comes with a custom `cache` location directly in the root of the project.

## Scripts

Runs the project once.

```
npm run start
```

Runs the project in development mode with reloading on save.

```
npm run dev
```
